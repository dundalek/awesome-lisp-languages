# Awesome Lisp Languages

A list of lisp-flavored programming languages implemented on top of existing programming languages.

### Why should I care as a lisp programmer?

If you already love s-expressions then lisp-flavored languages will make it nicer when you need to build on existing platforms. In case the target language does not support advanced features like macros and REPL-driven development, these can often be easily added by using the s-expressions layer.

The second point is about helping to spread lisp and its powerful ideas more. The example of Clojure and its relative popularity shows that being hosted on existing mainstream language and leveraging ecosystems of existing libraries is a key to broader adoption. It also lowers the barrier for people to try lisp and learn about the ideas behind it. Traditionally to learn lisp one needs to learn and get used to very unfamiliar syntax while at the same time being exposed to a completely new environment and ecosystem. Taking the environment out of the equation can make the experience of trying out lisp more approachable.

### Why should I care as a programmer in other language?

Learning about Lisp will make you a [better programmer](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html). You can pick any language below based on the language you are familiar with to get you started with the [lisp syntax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) more easily. It is also worth to read a post to get [intuition for lisp syntax](https://stopa.io/post/265).

In general when one learns any new programming language it opens new horizons and improves programming insight. Modern programming languages are converging and sometimes are being very similar to each other. The similarities can be missed because they are hidden behind a specific syntax.

If we translate the languages to a common syntax the similarities are more apparent and the different concepts stand out more. That way we can focus on the new innovative concepts and ideas to broaden our horizons.



## Classification

- **Type-A**: Simple syntax mapping  
*These languages usually just provide s-expressions (parentheses) syntax and are translated to the target language without extra features/semantics. Also sometimes being called transpilers.*

- **Type-B**: Syntax and additional semantics  
*In addition to translating the syntax some additional features/semantics that are not present in the target language are added. Usually if a language does not fit in other category, it can be considered being a Type-B.*

- **Type-C**: [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)-like  
*Distinctive syntax that besides parentheses also uses brackets and curly braces. Distinctive features are persistent data structures, namespaces and vars, protocols.*

- **Type-L**: [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)  
*Implementing ANSI Common Lisp standard or being inspired by it.*

- **Type-S**: [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29)  
*Implementing some of RxRS standards or being inspired by Scheme.*

## Languages

Listed primarily by the language which can be used for interoperability / [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface).

*Language section does not necessarily mean the language of the implementation. For example `Ferret` compiles into `C++` but the compiler is written in `Clojure`. Or `Carp` interops with `C` but it is mostly written in `Haskell`. In case of `SBCL` it contains only small amounts of `C`, but it is implemented almost entirely in `Common Lisp`.*
